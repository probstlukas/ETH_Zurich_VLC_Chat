# Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing - Assignment 5

**Course:** Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing  
**Institution:** ETH Zurich  
**Semester:** Winter 2022/23  
**Collaborators:** Mélina Sladic, Lukas Probst

## Overview

This repository contains the project for Assignment 5 in the *Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing* course at ETH Zurich. The project was developed as part of my exchange semester in Winter 2022/23 in collaboration with Mélina Sladic.

## Project Description

In this assignment, we implemented a *Visible Light Communication (VLC)* system using Arduino and Python. The main goal was to create a chat application that transmits messages via visible light, showcasing the potential of VLC technology as an alternative communication method.

The project involved:

- Setting up a VLC channel using Arduino to send and receive data through LEDs.
- Developing a Python-based chat application that facilitates text-based communication over VLC.
- Exploring the limitations and challenges of VLC, including data transfer rates, noise interference, and light modulation.
